- Applied by network tags or service accounts
- Implied rules (allow egress, deny ingress by default)
- Direction: ingress (incoming) or egress (outgoing)

#### Routes
- Define paths for network traffic to reach destinations
- System-generated routes for subnet and internet connectivity
- Custom routes for specific routing requirements
- Route priorities determine which route is used

### Internet Connectivity

#### External IP Addresses

## Best Practices

### Security
- **Identity and Access Management**:
  - Use least privilege principle with IAM
  - Implement service account best practices
  - Enable audit logging for all services
  - Use Workload Identity for GKE workloads
  - Regular IAM policy reviews and cleanup
- **Network Security**:
  - Implement network segmentation with firewall rules
  - Use private Google access for internal traffic
  - Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring
  - Implement hierarchical firewall policies
- **Data Protection**:
  - Enable encryption at rest and in transit
  - Use Cloud KMS for key management
  - Implement data loss prevention (DLP)
  - Regular security assessments and penetration testing

### Cost Optimization
- **Compute Optimization**:
  - Use committed use discounts for predictable workloads
  - Right-size compute resources with recommendations
  - Use preemptible/spot VMs for fault-tolerant workloads
  - Implement auto-scaling for variable workloads
- **Storage Optimization**:
  - Choose appropriate storage classes
  - Implement lifecycle management policies
  - Use regional storage for regional access patterns
  - Monitor and optimize BigQuery query costs
- **Monitoring and Alerting**:
  - Set up billing alerts and budgets
  - Implement resource labeling and monitoring
  - Use Cloud Asset Inventory for resource tracking
  - Regular cost reviews and optimization

### Reliability and Disaster Recovery
- **High Availability Design**:
  - Deploy across multiple zones or regions
  - Use managed services when possible
  - Implement health checks and monitoring
  - Design for graceful degradation
- **Backup and Recovery**:
  - Regular backup and disaster recovery testing
  - Cross-region backup replication
  - Document RTO and RPO requirements
  - Automate recovery procedures

### Performance Optimization
- **Compute Performance**:
  - Choose appropriate machine types and storage classes
  - Use regional resources to reduce latency
  - Implement connection pooling and efficient coding practices
